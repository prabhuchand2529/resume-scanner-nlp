# Resume Scanner using Machine Learning & NLP

## Project Overview
This project is an intelligent Resume Screening System that automatically analyzes resumes and matches them with job descriptions using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
The system ranks resumes based on skill relevance and keyword similarity, helping recruiters quickly identify the most suitable candidates.

## Features
- Extracts text from resumes (PDF format)
- Uses NLP techniques for text processing
- Applies TF-IDF Vectorization
- Calculates Cosine Similarity for matching
- Ranks candidates automatically
- Reduces manual screening effort

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Cosine Similarity
- PyPDF2

## How It Works
1. Upload resume files and a job description.
2. System extracts text from resumes.
3. Converts text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.
4. Computes similarity between resumes and job description.
5. Displays ranked results.

## How to Run
Install dependencies:
pip install scikit-learn PyPDF2

Run this project:
python main.py

## Use Case
